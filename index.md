Conversation or *dialogue* is the most natural way in which we humans use language, and arguably the holy grail of language-enabled AI systems. With machine learning advancing at such a rapid pace, we now have powerful tools for modelling interacting agents. Yet, to model human-like conversational abilities remains remarkably difficult. This course will examine what makes dialogue so challanging, delving into classic and contemporary research in linguistics, cognitive science, NLP and artificial intelligence. 

#### Learning Objectives

The course will be research-oriented and project-based, and it will involve reading and critiquing current related work. The goal of the course is to help you develop the following: 

  - Familiarity with fundamental concepts in the study of dialogue interaction
  - Deep understanding of the theoretical and empirical basis of current computational models and their limitations
  - Practice in carrying out novel research related to dialogue modelling

Although we will discuss current NLP and machine learning methods applied to dialogue, and you will have the chance to work with these methods in the final project, the goal of the course is *not* to teach you how to build dialogue systems or chatbots.
